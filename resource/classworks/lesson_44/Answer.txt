1. The more efficient algorithm in WRITING is recursive because the amount of characters is less than that of the iterative algorithm.

2. The iterative algorithm is more efficient because there is a less chance of a stackoverflow error and that it uses less memory in terms of running in a loop-like functionality.

3. The positives of recursion is that it can easily accomplish simple loop-like tasks, while the downside is that it is much more inefficient in terms of runtime than just using a loop.
