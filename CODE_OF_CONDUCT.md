REWRITE IN PROCESS THIS IS NOT THE LATEST FIX TO THE CC

# Code of Conduct

As the lead of contribution to this repository, I am pledging to provide the highest quality content along with the most amount of support while this reposoitory is active.
The content will always be published one day after the original assignment was due. However, you should also be aware, that whatever you see here does not have to be "only" solution.
This leads us to saying that here, you aren't supposed to just copy and paste code, instead I would like you to get "an idea" for the assignment and actually learn something.

# Code Contract

Even though these pieces of code might seem "good" and for you to simply search it up, you should note that whatever you copy and paste can be easily searched up, as the code here are all
public to the web. Whom your teacher might be can find out, and it will be then your duty to explain your actions. Plus, if you are copy and pasting, why are you taking APCS?
