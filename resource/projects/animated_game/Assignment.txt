Your task is to create your own animated game. This game does not need to be an original idea, but it does need to meet certain requirements.


Your game must include:
1. An ArrayList
2. A 2-dimensional array
3. Inheritance
4. At least one timer
5. An end
6. Scorekeeping
7. User interaction (i.e., KeyListener, MouseListener, etc)
8. Proper encapsulation techniques

My note:
Requirement 1 & 2 can be combined
