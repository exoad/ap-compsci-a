# Files

For each project and assignment, the code and assignment details would be put into a seperate folder.

Most MARKDOWN files will be written and parsed in HTML

Check in the folder `/resource/`. Folders besides this folder should be ignored unless you are running this entire repo.

For files related to the view program please check the branch `view-program`

### View Program

I created this program so you could easily find anything you are looking for without having to look through this master branch manually. Just run the program and yea :).

# Notice

*   This repo is only for resources and not to teach you anything directly.
*   Binary files will not be distributed
*   For some files, in order to run them you might need to remove the `package` statement from the top of the file
*   Run code at your own risk and use code at your own risk (in regardance with the [license](./LICENSE.md))

# Code Quality

If I have a current assignment, I will not put it on this REPO before it is due!

There is a Codacy Badge above that will show this branch's Code quality and Grade, with `A` being the best, etc..

Some workflows to improve Code Quality are the following Workflows: `Prettier, Codacy, Discord Webhook`
