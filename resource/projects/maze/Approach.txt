Basically after asking the teacher, it is required for the project to have at least FOUR recursive calls, I used these 4 
recursive calls for looking in the directions of the blocks near me in a way so:

       A
          +Y
       |  
   -X     +X
B  --  X  --  C
    
       |
          -Y
       D
       
Now there are many other ways to approach this, but for me one could quickly identify this could be solveable with a simple
implementation of a FF-algorithm (Flood-Fill), however one could also try a DFS-approach (although this seems counter-intuitive).

Flood-Fill in simple terms is basically an algorithm that runs through the avaliable paths and literally fill them with a value.
Flood-Fill for our example will of course utilize 4 major recursive calls which will help us to walk in the directions:
1. Right
2. Left
3. Up
4. Down

One can find a good pseudocode-ish implementation of this algorithm here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_fill

Each of these will calls for each direction will fill each avaliable "open" path. Each time it is called, it will attempt
this recursive behavior for a N times or 1 time and thus proceed to whenever it finds the finish.
